Hi,


Test data exist for days  2018-03-23 - 2018-03-19. You are able to select other days,
however the chatbox will inform you that there are no messages for that day.

While using an HTML validator, there was one error on index.html line 101, however only seems to be an error for IE,
but is fully supported in both Chrome and Firefox, so deemed as not an issue.

Cheers,
